# ucwajs
Implements very basic functionality to communicate with the Skype for Business Web API (UCWA).

## Experimental!
This library is in a very experimental state. Do expect problems and obstacles ahead ðŸ’©

## Configuration & Preparation
Run `npm install` and create a copy of `config.sample.json` named `config.json`. Fill in your Skype for Business credentials.


## Run
```bash
npm run
```

## Debug
`ucwajs` uses `debug` to provide traces during runtime. Enable them by passing the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=ucawjs npm run
```
